#  🚀 Ekart Web Application – CI/CD Automated using Jenkins

## About

This project showcases a fully automated CI/CD pipeline setup using Jenkins, applied to a Spring Boot-based shopping cart web application.

The core objective was to go beyond just building a Java web application — the focus here was to **implement complete automation** from code analysis to containerized deployment using modern DevOps practices.

💡 What This Project Demonstrates:
- Two Jenkins jobs:

    - CI_Pipeline: Handles code checkout, static code analysis with SonarQube, security vulnerability scanning with OWASP Dependency Check,           builds the application using Maven, creates a Docker image, and pushes it to DockerHub.

    - CD_Pipeline: Automatically triggered by CI_Pipeline, pulls the Docker image and runs the application inside a Docker container exposed on       port 8070.

### Maven Wrapper

#### Using the Maven Plugin

Go to the root folder of the application and type:
```bash
$ chmod +x scripts/mvnw
$ scripts/mvnw spring-boot:run
```

#### Using Executable Jar

Or you can build the JAR file with 
```bash
$ scripts/mvnw clean package
``` 

Then you can run the JAR file:
```bash
$ java -jar target/shopping-cart-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

### Maven

Open a terminal and run the following commands to ensure that you have valid versions of Java and Maven installed:

```bash
$ java -version
java version "1.8.0_102"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_102-b14)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.102-b14, mixed mode)
```

```bash
$ mvn -v
Apache Maven 3.3.9 (bb52d8502b132ec0a5a3f4c09453c07478323dc5; 2015-11-10T16:41:47+00:00)
Maven home: /usr/local/Cellar/maven/3.3.9/libexec
Java version: 1.8.0_102, vendor: Oracle Corporation
```

#### Using the Maven Plugin

The Spring Boot Maven plugin includes a run goal that can be used to quickly compile and run your application. 
Applications run in an exploded form, as they do in your IDE. 
The following example shows a typical Maven command to run a Spring Boot application:
 
```bash
$ mvn spring-boot:run
``` 

#### Using Executable Jar

To create an executable jar run:

```bash
$ mvn clean package
``` 

To run that application, use the java -jar command, as follows:

```bash
$ java -jar target/shopping-cart-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

To exit the application, press **ctrl-c**.

### Docker

It is possible to run **shopping-cart** using Docker:

Build Docker image:
```bash
$ mvn clean package
$ docker build -t shopping-cart:dev -f docker/Dockerfile .
```

Run Docker container:
```bash
$ docker run --rm -i -p 8070:8070 \
      --name shopping-cart \
      shopping-cart:dev
```

##### Helper script

It is possible to run all of the above with helper script:

```bash
$ chmod +x scripts/run_docker.sh
$ scripts/run_docker.sh
```

## Docker 

Folder **docker** contains:

* **docker/shopping-cart/Dockerfile** - Docker build file for executing shopping-cart Docker image. 
Instructions to build artifacts, copy build artifacts to docker image and then run app on proper port with proper configuration file.

## Util Scripts

* **scripts/run_docker.sh.sh** - util script for running shopping-cart Docker container using **docker/Dockerfile**

## Tests

Tests can be run by executing following command from the root of the project:

```bash
$ mvn test
```

## Helper Tools

### HAL REST Browser

Go to the web browser and visit `http://localhost:8070/`

You will need to be authenticated to be able to see this page.

### H2 Database web interface

Go to the web browser and visit `http://localhost:8070/h2-console`

In field **JDBC URL** put 
```
jdbc:h2:mem:shopping_cart_db
```

In `/src/main/resources/application.properties` file it is possible to change both
web interface url path, as well as the datasource url.
